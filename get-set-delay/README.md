# Overview

This repository contains the get-set smart contract.  Deploy the smart contract via the Xooa console, refer to  <https://github.com/Xooa/samples/blob/master/README.md> to get started, deploying **Xooa-get-set** from this repository.

Here, we'll show you how to invoke a smart contract and write data to the blockchain with a delay of 1 second and how to retrieve that data.
